              PLUS had been using a design system created two years ago. Over
              time, as the design team added more styles and components, it
              became <strong>inconsistent</strong> and
              <strong>hard to use</strong> for both designers and developers. We
              needed to upgrade it!

              transitioned the team to a new design system. Specifically, I
              optimized component setup for consistency, created detailed
              documentation, facilitated developer communication, and
              effectively delegated tasks. This project achieved a
              <strong>100%</strong> onboarding rate and a
              <strong>40%</strong> increase in prototype creation speed.

            At this point, two new designers joined the design system upgrade

              I maintained close collaboration with developers and the PM by

              To support adoption among designers, I initiated a facelift
              project for all 18 design team members, helping them learn the new

            I'm really proud of challenging myself as a beginner to dive deep
            into the design system—a topic that once felt overwhelming and a bit
            intimidating. Taking the initiative to improve the system step by
            step and seeing how it made my coworkers' lives easier was
            incredibly rewarding. By the end, I felt I had truly grown into
            someone who understands and can contribute meaningfully to design
            systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Another highlight was collaborating closely with PMs and developers,
            which gave me a better understanding of their workflows and made our
            teamwork smoother. I also took on leadership responsibilities, like
            planning meetings and onboarding new members, which pushed me to
            grow in unexpected ways. I couldn't have done it without the support
            of my amazing design lead, whose encouragement kept me motivated
            throughout.
