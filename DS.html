              developer communication, and effectively delegated tasks. This

            Besides assigning tasks, I hosted the Design System Squad meeting
            with Cassie to plan our next steps. Later on, we also set up and led
            meetings with developers to discuss the handoff progress.

            said, "Building a design system is only half the battle; the real
            challenge is getting it adopted by both designers and developers."
            We ensured that the new design system was correctly used by everyone
            on the team.

              With the development team, we ensured close collaboration by
              setting up weekly meetings and co-designing the sprint plans. This
              proactive approach ensured that the design system implementation
              was not pushed to the bottom of their stack.

              I also provided guidance to new Design System team members on how
              to set up the notion cards for the developers. We made sure it was
              clear how to implement the design system for the developers and
              easy for them to track the task.

              We designed a task for both new and old designers to learn how to
              use the design system by doing. All designers practiced
              replicating the current app design and replacing old design
              elements with new components and variables.

              No one is left behind on this task. Cassie and I provided
              tutorials for each step, and designers are paired with Design
              System Squad members to support their progress and address any
              challenges.

            I was glad that I challenged myself to delve deep into the design
            system, which had seemed mysterious and a bit intimidating. Now, I
            am confident in calling myself a design system expert. Seeing a once
            messy design system become organized and aligned with industry
            standards is incredibly rewarding.

            I also enjoyed guiding new members onboard and taking a leadership
            role in planning and facilitating meetings. It was great to have
            more opportunities to communicate with developers, which helped me
            understand their workflow better. A shout out to my dear design
            lead, who provided me with lots of positive feedback and
            encouragement during this project.
