          <p class="text">
            MyHealthyPregnancy is an app that provides timely risk
            identification and intervention during pregnancy.<br /><br />My task
            was to do user research on current users and iterate the design
            based on feedback.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Before I started user research, I first analyzed 3 most popular
            pregnancy apps to find out common features and layouts.

            Among all features, size guide and social network feature were not
            only the most common ones, but also frequently mentioned in user
            interviews. This suggested that users really cared these two
            features, and they definitely should be added into the app.

            1. Check-ins are too frequent and are not customizable<br />
            2. Weight tracker is hard to use (only track once a week + can't

            3. Want a commodity forum to chat with other users<br />
            4. On the home screen:<br />
            &emsp; a. Not much information on baby's change <br />

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p class="text">
            One month before this internship started, I knew nothing about
            UI/UX, not to mention how to use Figma. In four weeks, I managed to
            self study UI design principles and UX design process from online
            resources, and gradually became familiar with Figma.<br /><br />
            It was a great experience to collaborate with data analyst and UX
            researcher in the team. I got to know how to write interview script
            so that users would be willing to provide honest feedback, and also
            got the chance to analyze qualitative and quantitative data from
            survey results. Being able to incorporate user feedback into design
            and conduct unmoderated usability testing were brand new experiences
            for me. The feeling of being connected with users through my design
            was so exciting.<br /><br />
            Since the company was very small (only 7 people), I also took on the
            role of debugging the app and reviewing the logic document, which
            spent a lot of time. Therefore, I wasn't able to come up with
            multiple iterations for usability testing. In the future, I will try
            to iterate as much as I can to create and test more design ideas.<br /><br />

              >Overall, I was very proud of my first UX design project!</strong
