              app issues and ideas of new features.<br /><br />How can I conduct

            Among all features, size guide and social network feature seem to be

            usually need these two features, and we could consider adding them
            to our app.

              After finishing the design, I conducted unmoderated usability
              testing on 6 active users using Maze. I provided them with 5
              tasks, ranging from easy (Find your body's changes) to difficult
              (Comment on the latest discussion in the "October 2022 Birth"
              group in the community forum).

                  of the users responded that they find the task easy to
                  complete. The completion rate for each task were 100%, except
                  for the last difficult task, which also has a high 80% rate.
                  They expressed that they love the new variety of colors and
                  the overall design.

                  Some users mentioned changes that they would like to have on

                  an appointment and hotlines for doctors.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p class="text">
            One month before this internship started, I knew nothing about
            UI/UX, not to mention how to use Figma. In four weeks, I managed to
            self study UI design principles and UX design process from online
            resources, and gradually became familiar with Figma.<br /><br />
            It was a great experience to collaborate with data analyst and UX
            researcher in the team. I got to know how to write interview script
            so that users would be willing to provide honest feedback, and also
            got the chance to analyze qualitative and quantitative data from
            survey results. Being able to incorporate user feedback into design
            and conduct unmoderated usability testing were brand new experiences
            for me. The feeling of being connected with users through my design
            was so exciting.<br /><br />
            Since the company was very small (only 7 people), I also took on the
            role of debugging the app and reviewing the logic document, which
            spent a lot of time. Therefore, I wasn't able to come up with
            multiple iterations for usability testing. In the future, I will try
            to iterate as much as I can to create and test more design ideas.<br /><br />
