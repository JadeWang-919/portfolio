          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Our client, Center for Shared Prosperity (CSP), is an organization
            that aims to find solutions regarding socioeconomic inequities and
            building a model of community-university collaboration at Carnegie
            Mellon University (CMU).<br /><br />Our task was to extend the
            <a
              class="CSP-link"
              href="https://csppgh.squarespace.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >original CSP website</a
            >
            to another responsive website reiterating the goals of CSP and a
            database of local minority-owned businesses in Pittsburgh. We wish
            to create a platform for the CMU community to get access to a
            searchable database and educate student, faculty, and staff
            populations about the power of supporting local minoritized
            businesses.<br /><br />
            One challenge we face is that we are not able to do back-end
            development such as actually linking the database to the website.
            Therefore, our final deliverable is not a functional website that
            links to the database but a prototype that shows the overall design
            of the website.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="text">
            We reviewed the websites of other committees and organizations with
            similar overarching goals and website implementations to our
            website. We then analyzed their strengths and weaknesses to help us
            recognize how we can improve our website.
          </p>

          <img
            class="competitive-analysis"
            src="img/ShopMinority/competitive-analysis.jpg"
            alt="Competitive analysis"
          />

          <p class="text">
            Based on competitive analysis and discussion with our client, we
            decided to implement a website with a search bar at the top, filters
            that can turn to dropdown menus on mobile screen, a carousel for a
            featured list, card layout for business list, and a business info
            page for each business. We also included a form for users to
            recommend a local minoritized business.<br /><br />
            One unique feature of our website is that we use a Scottish Terrier
            icon as a clickable popup that tells why CMU community should
            support local minoritized business. This can make our users feel
            connected with the site, as the Scottish Terrier is the official
            mascot of CMU.

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>

          <p class="text">
            Our target audience is the CMU community, including students,
            faculty and staff. To ensure that we are reaching the proper
            audience, our website has a section dedicated to educating the CMU
            community about the power of supporting local economies with an
            emphasis on the value of patronizing minority businesses.
            <br /><br />
            Our website contains a directory of minority-owned businesses, but
            we expect the majority of the visitors to be the potential customers
            of these businesses from the CMU community, not the owners
            themselves.

            We tested four users from the CMU community, including 2 students, 1

            layout, student 1 tested the mobile layout, and student 2 tested the
            tablet layout. The testing sessions are all conducted in person. We
            reminded the users to always talk aloud their thought process, gave
            them 5 specific tasks to complete (4 simple ones and 1 complex one),
            and enabled them to explore the prototype on their own at the end of
            the sessions.

          <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Our client already has a primary and secondary color palette that he
            wants us to use for this new website. Overall, the colors show a
            vibrant website personality, as the website is aimed at a relatively
            young population (CMU community).<br /><br />
            The primary color palette is provided below. There are three colors
            chosen as the foundational colors for the website. Black and white
            are for the text, and the cream color serves as the background color
            for the whole website. The client chose the cream color as it
            specifically references manila folders used in government documents.
          </p>

            src="img/ShopMinority/primary color.png"

          />
          <p class="text">
            The secondary color palette is provided below. These colors are used
            for buttons, sections' background colors, etc. This secondary color
            palette is a set of vibrant colors inspired by construction paper
            used in making protest posters. The reason our client chose these
            colors is that the website identity can be physically replicated by
            using standard crafting supplies, thus showing that this website is
            meant for everyone and can be made by everyone.

          <p class="text">
            This was a great opportunity to be able to complete a project that
            solves a client's need! It was interesting to design a website that
            is based on the style of another site. I enjoyed my first time
            collaborating with two other members for a UX design project,
            designing new website using user-centered approach, and writing code
            for a website together. Group work and user testing sessions brought
            so many new perspectives that I have never thought of, and it was
            satisfying to see our prototype gradually improving.
