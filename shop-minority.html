          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Our client, Center for Shared Prosperity (CSP), is an organization
            that aims to find solutions regarding socioeconomic inequities and
            building a model of community-university collaboration at Carnegie
            Mellon University.<br /><br />Our task was to extend the
            <a
              class="CSP-link"
              href="https://csppgh.squarespace.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >original CSP website</a
            >
            to another responsive website reiterating the goals of CSP and a
            database of local minority-owned businesses in Pittsburgh. We wish
            to create a platform for the CMU community to get access to a
            searchable database and educate student, faculty, and staff
            populations about the power of supporting local minoritized
            businesses.<br /><br />
            One challenge we face is that we are not able to do back-end
            development such as actually linking the database to the website.
            Therefore, our final deliverable will not be a functional website
            that links to the database but a prototype that shows the overall
            design of the website.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="text">
            We reviewed the websites of other committees and organizations with
            similar overarching goals and website implementations to our
            website. We then analyzed their strengths and weaknesses to help us
            recognize how we can improve our website.

          />

          <p class="text">
            Based on competitive analysis and discussion with our client, we
            decided to implement a website with a search bar at the top, filters
            that can turn to dropdown menus on mobile screen, a carousel for a
            featured list, card layout for business list, and a business info
            page for each business. We also included a form for users to
            recommend a local minoritized business.

          <h2>User Research</h2>

          <p class="text">
            Our target audience is CMU-related people, including students,
            faculty and staff. To ensure that we are reaching the proper
            audience, our website will have a section dedicated to educating the
            CMU community about the power of supporting local economies with an
            emphasis on the value of patronizing minority businesses.
            <br /><br />
            Our website contains a directory of minority-owned businesses, but
            we expect the majority of the visitors to be the potential customers
            of these businesses from the CMU community, not the owners
            themselves.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p class="text">
            One month before this internship started, I knew nothing about
            UI/UX, not to mention how to use Figma. In four weeks, I managed to
            self study UI design principles and UX design process from online
            resources, and gradually became familiar with Figma.<br /><br />
            It was a great experience to collaborate with data analyst and UX
            researcher in the team. I got to know how to write interview script
            so that users would be willing to provide honest feedback, and also
            got the chance to analyze qualitative and quantitative data from
            survey results. Being able to incorporate user feedback into design
            and conduct unmoderated usability testing were brand new experiences
            for me. The feeling of being connected with users through my design
            was so exciting.<br /><br />
            Since the company was very small (only 7 people), I also took on the
            role of debugging the app and reviewing the logic document, which
            spent a lot of time. Therefore, I wasn't able to come up with
            multiple iterations for usability testing. In the future, I will try
            to iterate as much as I can to create and test more design ideas.<br /><br />
            <strong
              >Overall, I was very proud of my first UX design project!</strong
