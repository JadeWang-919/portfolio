              Our client, Center for Shared Prosperity (CSP), is an organization from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that aims to support the Pittsburgh community. They needed a platform for the CMU community to access a <strong>searchable database</strong> and educate student, faculty, and staff populations about the power of <strong

            <p class="text">
              Using the CSP brand toolkit, we created a responsive
              database-searching website for the CMU community that provides
              information about local minority-owned businesses in Pittsburgh
              while emphasizing the importance of supporting them.
              <br /><br />
              Due to time contraint, we are not able to do back-end development
              such as linking the database to the website. Therefore,
              our final deliverable is just a prototype showing the overall
              design of the website.

                <p class="text">For mobile layout, 2 users reported difficulty to find where to submit a business and go back to main site as the buttons were placed at the bottom. To address this, we introduced a <strong>hamburger menu</strong> that displayed a search bar, "nominate a business," and the CSP logo when expanded. This modification also ensured <strong>consistent navigation bar layout</strong> across desktop, tablet, and mobile versions.

        <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Our client wanted the databased website to share the same brand toolkit as their original CSP website. Overall, the colors show a
          vibrant website personality, as the website is aimed at a relatively
          young population (CMU community).<br /><br />
          The primary color palette consists of three foundational colors for the website. Black and white
          are for the text, and the cream color serves as the background color
          for the whole website. The client chose the cream color as it
          specifically references manila folders used in government documents.

        />
        <p class="text">
          The secondary color palette is used
          for buttons, sections' background colors, etc. This secondary color
          palette is a set of vibrant colors inspired by construction paper
          used in making protest posters. The reason our client chose these
          colors is that the website identity can be physically replicated by
          using standard crafting supplies, thus showing that this website is
          meant for everyone and can be made by everyone.

            This project provided me with a valuable chance to address a real client's need, turning their idea into a functional website. Designing a website using another site's brand toolkit was an interesting experience for me, and the ongoing communication with the client allowed us to transform their concept into a tangible website solution.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
           I also enjoyed my first time collaborating with two other members for a UX and web design project. Together, we designed a new website using user-centered approach, and combined our code to make the website actually work. Group work and user testing sessions brought so many new perspectives that I have never thought of, and it was satisfying to see our prototype gradually improving.
