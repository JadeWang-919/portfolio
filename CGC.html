              Google Cloud offers hundreds of products, but users often struggle
              to find the right tools. In this capstone project, our goal was to
              collaborate with Google Cloud team to
              <strong>simplify product discovery</strong>
              by redesigning the browsing experience, making it easier and

              browsing process, reduced unnecessary scrolling, and made product
              discovery 30% faster. As part of a 7-person team, I played a key
              role in defining project goals, keeping the team aligned, and

                Google Cloud's wide range of categories make finding specific

                main categories and subcategories at a glance, allowing users to
                locate products quickly and efficiently.

              As advised by our mentor, we combined the strengths of both
              interaction-focused and AI-driven concepts to develop a prototype
              featuring dynamic filters and AI-powered personalization. These
              designs

              Throughout this phase, I frequently reviewed design files and
              deliverables to ensure they were error-free and polished. When
              issues went unnoticed, I proactively fixed them to
              <strong>maintain quality and consistency</strong>.

            This project taught me the importance of
            <strong>proactive communication and leadership</strong> in a
            large-scale design collaboration. Throughout the project, I
            facilitated discussions when meetings fell silent, ensured alignment
            on project goals, and took initiative in decision-making. Managing
            stakeholder relationships was a crucial learning experience‚ÄîI
            learned how to adapt communication styles for different audiences,
            balancing the needs of Google Cloud's stakeholders with
            user-centered design principles. It was incredibly rewarding when a
            teammate told me, "This project wouldn't be as successful without
            you."
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Looking ahead, I'd love to explore more experimental approaches to
            cloud product discovery, such as removing traditional product cards
            and embracing more immersive, guided selection experiences.
            Additionally, since this was an ideation-focused project, the next
            logical step would be conducting usability testing to validate our
            concepts with real users. I'm excited to take these learnings
            forward as I continue designing solutions that simplify complex
            digital experiences.

              Thank you again for all the fantastic work on this project. It is
              no easy task to take such a robust, complex ecosystem and break it
              down into a working strategy model to inform designs as you all
              did. Our web directors have been very impressed and we are so
              thankful for this collaboration that has also been a huge learning
              experience for us from the work ya'll have done!
