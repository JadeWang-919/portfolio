              I played a key role in defining project goals, keeping the team

                Google Cloud's wide range of categories make finding specific

                locate products quickly and efficiently.

              To tackle the unfamiliarity with cloud technology, we started by

              e-commerce platforms. The wide scope of this project initially

              As advised by our mentor, we combined the strengths of both
              interaction-focused and AI-driven concepts to develop a prototype
              featuring dynamic filters and AI-powered personalization. These
              designs

              Throughout this phase, I frequently reviewed design files and
              deliverables to ensure they were error-free and polished. When
              issues went unnoticed, I proactively fixed them to
              <strong>maintain quality and consistency</strong>.

          <p class="text">
            What this project taught me the most was the importance of proactive
            communication and collaboration. I often facilitated discussions
            when Zoom meetings fell into awkward silence and ensured action
            items‚Äîsuch as booking times or setting deadlines‚Äîwere completed when
            others overlooked them. Regularly clarifying the project goals with
            our mentor kept us on track. It was incredibly rewarding when a
            teammate remarked, "This project wouldn't be as successful without
            you."

            Although this was an ideation project, testing features like
            personalization and evaluation tools with real users would be the
            next potential step. Finally, I would love to explore more
            unconventional ideas, such as removing traditional product cards,
            which can freshen my thinking and break traditional norms even more.
